  <P>One of my favourite type of Blog is the “tech blog”.  Now this isn’t something new to blog about, as Tech bloggers have been blogging about technology news and gadget reviews in detail online since the beginning of the internet, But because it’s such a vast niche, you could carve out yourself a really good angle within the tech blog sphere. The trick is to have your own take on tech and don’t just follow the trend. One area which hasn’t really been covered specifically is eco tech, so something to think about. Maybe a blog specifically covering tech aimed at becoming more environmentally conscious.Anyway, here’s a few blogs in the tech niche that I really like and that I feel are doing something different and is thriving when it comes to organic traffic increases and revenue.</P>

  <p>A great site, which is highly useful and inspirational for people wanting to change their 9 to 5 lives for something that will allow them to live a little and spend more time with the family. The site is really simple, and something you could build yourself on WordPress in a matter of day, but the content is where this site excels. Podcasts, tools, tutorials and blog posts that target a specific niche is where this guy makes his money. His podcasts are really popular and when you have content that gets a lot of ears and eyes to it, then so will the advertising income.

    It’s the same with written content. If you have a popular page that get’s tens of thousands of views a month, then potentially you can sell ad space on those pages for hundreds of dollars a month, if not more.</p>

    <p>WeTheParents.org is one of my favorite parent blogs. Rather than getting Mom’s view or Dad’s opinion, you get both sides of the parenting story. The content is a real mixture, Neve, the Mom tends to write about empowering mom stuff whilst her husband, Keane, seems to be a big kid who spends his time playing with and reviewing kids toys.

      The main goal of this blog is to make parents’ lives easier by doing the research for them. It can be a pain trawling through Google and to find the best products, so this mom and dad team get geeky finding out which products are the best for the whole family. (And which gear is just a waste of money!)
      
      The site is beautifully designed and quick to load. It’s a great example of a simple WordPress theme that’s been well customized.</p>
